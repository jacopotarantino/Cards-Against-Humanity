# Cards Against Humanity Online demo

This is a project to try and create a sleek and sexy HTML5-based online version of the popular card game.


## Todo

First milestone is to create the look and feel of the client interface. Then create simulated game events for testing. Then code the server-side scripts that will allow real games to be played.

## Contributing

Please contribute to this project. The people who made Cards Against Humanity are awesome and open sourced their game(kinda). The least we can do is give a tiny bit back to them(and us by proxy. because let's face it: we wouldn't do this if the game weren't so fun.).
